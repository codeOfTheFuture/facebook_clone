        Consent according to GDPR Art. 6 Para. 1 S.1 lit. (b) for the processing of personal data can only
        be technically obtained by Facebook. Currently, Facebook does not offer such a consent option.
        Data processing through Facebook
        In its ruling on June 5, 2018, the European Court of Justice (https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/
        docs/application/pdf/2018-06/cp180081en.pdf) decided that the operator of a Facebook page is
        responsible for the processing of personal data together with Facebook.
        We are/I am aware that Facebook processes user data for the following purposes:
        • Advertising (analysis, provision of personalized advertising),
        • creation of user profiles, and
        • market research.
        Facebook uses cookies to store and further process this information, i.e. small text files that are
        stored on the user's various end devices. If the user has a Facebook profile and is logged in to it,
        it is also stored and analyzed across devices.
        Facebook's privacy policy contains further information on data processing: https://
        www.facebook.com/about/privacy.
        It is possible to opt out here: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads and here http://

        Facebook Inc., the US parent company of Facebook Ireland Ltd., is certified under the EU-U.S.
        Privacy Shield and thus promises to comply with European data protection guidelines. For more
        information on Facebook's Privacy Shield status, click here: https://www.privacyshield.gov/

        The transfer and further processing of users' personal data in third countries, e. g. the USA, as
        well as the associated possible risks for users cannot be excluded by us/me as the operator of
        this page.
        Statistical data
        Facebook's so-called "Insights" provides statistical data of different categories for this page and
        these statistics can be accessed by us/me. They are generated and provided by Facebook. As
        the operator of this page, we/I have no influence on their generation and presentation. We/I
        cannot disable this function or prevent the generation and processing of data. It is possible to
        select a certain time range to display statistics for the categories of likes, subscribers, reached
        persons and interacting persons to receive the following data from Facebook in relation to our/my
        Facebook page:
        Total number of page views, "Likes", page activity, post interactions, reach, video views, post
        reach, comments, shared content, answers, proportion of men and women, origin by country and
        city, language, visits to and clicks in the shop, clicks on route planners, clicks on telephone

        numbers. In the same manner, Facebook provides information about Facebook groups connected
        to our/my Facebook page.
        Due to the constant development of Facebook, the availability and processing of the data
        changes all the time, so that we/I once again refer to the link to Facebook's privacy policy already
        mentioned above for further details.
        We/I use this aggregated data to make our/my contributions and activities on our/my Facebook
        page more attractive to users. For example, we/I use the ratios regarding age and gender to
        appropriately address our/my visitors, and stats on when the most interactions take place to post
        at the most suitable time. Information about the type of devices used by visitors helps us/me to
        create the most suitable visuals. In accordance with the Facebook ToU, which each user has
        agreed to when creating their Facebook profile, we/I may identify the subscribers and likers of the
        page and view their profiles and other shared information about them.
        User rights
        If you have any questions about your rights, please contact Facebook directly.
        You have a right to free information about your personal data stored on Facebook and, if
        necessary, a right to correction, restriction of processing or deletion of this data. You also have
        the right to data transfer. Finally, you also have the right to complain about Facebook's processing
        of your personal data to the data protection supervisory authority.
        If information questions are submitted to us/me as the site operator, the additional agreement with
        Facebook obliges us to forward these questions — whether from private individuals or authorities
        — to Facebook within 7 days.
        This is also a result of the above-mentioned Controller Addendum: https://www.facebook.com/
        legal/terms/page controller addendum.
        If you need support or have any other questions, please contact us/me by email at this email
        address. If you no longer wish to have your data processed in the future as described here, please
        cancel the connection of your user profile to my/our page by using the function "Unlike this
        Page".
